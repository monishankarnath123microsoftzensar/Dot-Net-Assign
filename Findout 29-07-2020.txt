Protected internal in C#

The protected internal keyword combination is a member access modifier.
A protected internal member is accessible from the current assembly or from types that are derived from the containing class.
For a comparison of protected internal with the other access modifiers, see Accessibility Levels.

using System;
class One {
   protected internal int a = 50;
   private int b;
}
class Two : One {
   public Two() {
      Console.WriteLine(this.a);
   }
}
class Demo {
   static void Main() {
      Two t = new Two();
      // allowed since it is a derived class object
      t.a = 20;
   }
}
