Difference between Hashtable & Dictionary
Hashtable								Dictionary
Hashtable is included in the System.Collections namespace.		Dictionary is included in the System.Collections.Generic namespace.
Hashtable returns null if we try to find a key which does not exist.	Dictionary throws an exception if we try to find a key which does not exist.
Data retrieval is slower than dictionary because of boxing-unboxing.	Data retrieval is faster than Hashtable.

we should use the ListDictionary when we are certain the collection size will be less than 10 items.
The HybridDictionary is pretty much the same as Dictionary but will take advantage of the performance of ListDictionary when the collection size is less that 10 items.
Once the collection grows above 10 the HybridDictionary will switch from using ListDictionary internally to using a HashTable like an ordinary Dictionary.
If collection is usually under 10 items but at times could grow larger, then HybridDictionary will be the one to use.
